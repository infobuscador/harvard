### CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This repository hosts the project0 of the web programming course with Python and Javascript in which it has to be designed a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

The website is meeting the following requirements.

1. Has 3 sections for web search, images search and advanced search. 
2. On the upper right part of the page we can see 2 links that allow us to go to the images or advanced search section.
3. Once the user has clicked on the search button, the term is collected and the user is redirected to the google results page.
4. If the user does a search in the images section, we get the search term and we redirect to the google images results page.
5. In the advanced search the user has the option to make a search by: 
    * “all these words:”
    * “any of these words:”
    * “this exact word or phrase:”
    * “none of these words:”
6. The appearance on the Advanced Search page is similar as Google Advanced Search, the four options are stacked vertically with all text fields aligned to the left and the button has the same styles.
7. The Lucky button it has a similar behavior but not completely the same since in this phase of the course we did not see the part of javaScript that is responsible for taking the user to the first search result.
8. The aesthetics have been maintained as far as possible with the information acquired in this phase of the course.
